# Introduction
General idea:\
do a instance segmentation of pebbles see wt works better
why? search later

Sediment charateristics and grain-size distribution carries important information on the drainage system, the ecosystem, and the weather condition (Soloy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019). Unfortunately, traditional methods to manually collect these information are costly, labor intensive, and time consuming. Over the years, various techniques have been developed seeking to reduce manual input through machine learning. This project is an attempt to utilize a U-Net-SAM 2-pass approach in conjunction with stereo depth estimation to automize image based sampling. 

*This internship was supervised by Prof. Dr. Bodo Bookhagen.*

# Method
## Approach
This project approached the challenge from 2 angles. First, introduce a depth layer estimated through stereo disparity in addition to RGB. The rationale is to provide additional morphological information to improve the segmentatino accuracy. The use of stereo vision also provides the additional benefit that accurate size measurements is readily available and segmented results can easily be applied to the point cloud through the disparity map (Mustafah et al., 2012). 

Second, combine instance segmentation(Meta Segment-Anything) and semantic segmentation(U-Net) through a 2-pass approach to achieve extraction of individual grain samples. U-Net is a powerful tool capable of picking up features at different scale. Yet, while U-Net is capable of producing reliable results, it only performs a semantic segmentation. To separately sample individual grain, a second pass instance segmentation can be performed on top of the first pass U-Net result. The Meta Segment-Anything Model(SAM) was used in this project to perform the second pass segmentation.
